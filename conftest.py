"""pytest Local Config File

> üí° This is a special `pytest` file, so even if this is empty, please don't

Common fixtures and definitions for tests should go here, as this file will be
automatically imported and parsed by `pytest`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the outermost `config.py`, so this is the base for all others.
